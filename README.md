# Initial Express Server

This project is a basic Express.js server with bcrypt integration for hashing passwords. It includes a few simple routes to get started with Express and demonstrates how to use environment variables for managing bcrypt salt rounds.

## Features

- Basic routes to return simple responses.
- Integration with `bcrypt` to demonstrate password hashing.
- Environment variable support via `dotenv` for managing configuration like bcrypt salt rounds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/initial-express-server.git
   cd initial-express-server
   ```
````

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following environment variable:

   ```
   BCRYPT_SALT_ROUND=12
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Routes

The server provides the following routes:

### `/`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Returns "Hello World!" as a basic example of a route.

### `/home`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Returns "Hello Home!" as another example route.

### `/bcrypt`

- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Logs the salt rounds from the environment variable, generates a bcrypt salt, and hashes the password `hello123`. This is primarily for demonstration purposes.

### Wildcard Route (`*`)

- **Description**: Catches any undefined routes and returns "Route not found!".
